# Contributing to `DiscoGen`

The utility of DiscoGen dramatically increases as we improve the number and diversity of tasks supported by the generator. There are *five* main types of contributions to DiscoGen:

## New Domains

If you have an interesting idea for a new task that can fit the DiscoGen style, please add it (following the guidance in /). We will endeavour to add all well-implemented domains to make sure DiscoGen remains a live and fresh benchmark with significant open-source contribution.

## Improvements To Domains

Have you noticed more interesting modules in a pre-existing task than the original author? Great! Please feel free to separate out that module from the original codebase into a `base` and `edit` implementation! Simply increasing the number of modules in a codebase by one almost doubles the number of tasks supported in that domain! Improvements could also come through adding new backends, which can completely change the search space of a task without requiring significant edits.

## Adding New Datasets

Machine learning isn't static, and as our algorithms get better our datasets get bigger and harder! To ensure DiscoGen stays relevant, it needs to be regularly updated to support more cutting edge benchmarks and dataset. As well as ensuring we can be discovering algorithms at the frontier of human knowledge, adding a new dataset almost triples the number of tasks supported by a domain!

## New Evaluation Methods

Currently, DiscoGen supports three types of evaluation/objectives for ADAs: maximising performance, minimising energy usage of algorithms and minimise algorithm runtime. There are, undoubtedly, other things to focus on though; discovering memory-efficient algorithms, for instance!

## Bug-Fixes

If you spot any bugs in DiscoGen, please raise an issue and we will see to fix it as soon as possible!


# New to using Ruff and Mypy?

If you have not used ruff and mypy in your VS Code before, you can follow the following steps to set up a good development environment.

1. Install `charliermarsh/Ruff` and `ms-python/Mypy Type Checker` extension.
2. Open you workspace settings and paste the following:
```
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python",
    "mypy-type-checker.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment",
    "mypy-type-checker.reportingScope": "workspace",
    "mypy-type-checker.preferDaemon": true,
    "ruff.nativeServer": "on",
    "ruff.enable": true,
    "ruff.lint.enable": true,
    "ruff.organizeImports": true,
    "ruff.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment",
    "ruff.fixAll": true,
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.formatOnSaveMode": "file",
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll": "explicit",
            "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
        },
    },
    "cursorpyright.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off",
    "cursorpyright.analysis.exclude": ["**"],
    "makefile.configureOnOpen": false,
    "python.languageServer": "None",
}
```

These settings are meant to disable the annoying and redundant pyright/pylance errors and enable some sane defaults.

# Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `discogen` for local development.
Please note this documentation assumes you already have `uv` and `Git` installed and ready to go.

1. Fork the `discogen` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
cd <directory_in_which_repo_should_be_created>
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/discogen.git
```

3. Now we need to install the environment. Navigate into the directory

```bash
cd discogen
```

Then, install and activate the environment with:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

4. Install pre-commit to run linters/formatters at commit time:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

5. Create a branch for local development:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Don't forget to add test cases for your added functionality to the `tests` directory.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the formatting tests.

```bash
make check
```

Now, validate that all unit tests are passing:

```bash
make test
```

9. Before raising a pull request you should also run tox. (Optional)
   This will run the tests across different versions of Python:

```bash
tox
```

This requires you to have multiple versions of python installed.
This step is also triggered in the CI/CD pipeline, so you could also choose to skip this step locally.

10. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

11. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

# Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
   Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in `README.md`.


For more detailed guidance, please follow the instructions from our [documentation](https://AlexGoldie.github.io/discogen/how_to/overview/).
