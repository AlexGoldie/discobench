Image classification is a branch of computer vision focused on training models to categorize visual inputs into predefined classes. A digital image is a grid of pixels, where each pixel encodes color information as numerical values. These values are stored in binary format in computers, representing the intensity of color channels (typically red, green, and blue for RGB images). Unlike tasks that require understanding spatial relationships or generating new content, image classification distills an entire image into a single categorical label.

Historically, image classification draws from pattern recognition and statistical learning theory developed in the mid-20th century. Early approaches relied on hand-crafted features—such as edges, textures, and color histograms—combined with classical machine learning algorithms. The field was revolutionized in 2012 when deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved breakthrough performance on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating that hierarchical learned features could dramatically outperform engineered ones. The image-to-label pipeline—where a model receives pixel data as input and outputs class probabilities—remains central to modern approaches.

The objective of image classification is to learn a function that maps raw pixel values to class labels with high accuracy. Models achieve this by learning hierarchical representations: early layers detect low-level features like edges and colors, while deeper layers combine these into complex patterns representing objects, textures, and semantic concepts. Success in image classification requires sufficient training data, appropriate model architecture, and techniques to handle challenges like class imbalance, domain shift, and adversarial perturbations.

In practice, image classification serves as a foundation for numerous applications including medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, content moderation, and agricultural monitoring. Understanding the properties of image data—resolution, color spaces, and dataset statistics—is essential before implementing a classification system, as these factors influence model design and performance.

Below, we provide descriptions of the datasets which you will be training on. However, be aware that any code you develop may be applied to other image classification datasets too.
