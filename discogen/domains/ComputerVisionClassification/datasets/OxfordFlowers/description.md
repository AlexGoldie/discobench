DESCRIPTION
Oxford Flowers 102 is a fine-grained visual classification dataset featuring 102 flower species commonly found in the United Kingdom. The dataset presents significant challenges due to large variations in scale, pose, lighting, and high inter-class similarity. It is widely used for evaluating fine-grained recognition and transfer learning approaches.

OBSERVATION SPACE
Each observation is a color image of variable size containing one or more flowers. Images exhibit natural variation in composition, background, and lighting conditions.

CLASSES
The dataset contains 102 flower categories with high visual similarity between some species.

DATASET STRUCTURE
Total images: between 4,080 and 26,316 (40-258 images per class)
Class distribution is imbalanced
Images feature large within-class variation and between-class similarity
Typical splits: training, validation, and test sets provided
