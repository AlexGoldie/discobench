DESCRIPTION
Stanford Cars is a fine-grained vehicle classification dataset containing images of cars with class labels defined at the Make-Model-Year level. The dataset captures significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, making it challenging for distinguishing between visually similar car models and years.

OBSERVATION SPACE
Each observation is a color image of variable size showing a car, typically from various angles and in different settings.

CLASSES
The dataset contains 196 classes representing different car make-model-year combinations (e.g., 2012 Tesla Model S, 2012 BMW M3 coupe).

DATASET STRUCTURE
Training set: 8,144 images
Test set: 8,041 images
Approximately 50-50 split between training and testing within each class
Total: 16,185 images
