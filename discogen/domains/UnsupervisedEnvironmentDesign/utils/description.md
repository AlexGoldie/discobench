Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning focused on training agents to make sequences of decisions in an environment to maximize a notion of cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from labeled examples, RL agents learn through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on their actions. The core idea is that the agent explores the environment, evaluates the outcomes of its actions, and gradually improves its decision-making policy to achieve better long-term results.

Historically, RL draws inspiration from behavioral psychology, particularly the study of how animals learn from rewards and punishments. The agent-environment interaction loop—where the agent observes the state of the environment, takes an action, and receives a reward—remains central to all RL formulations. In this loop, the environment defines the challenges the agent must overcome.

While traditional RL focuses on mastering a fixed environment, a key challenge is ensuring agents can generalize to new, unseen situations. This has led to the field of Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), where the goal is to automatically generate a curriculum of training environments that progressively challenge an agent. Instead of a static world, a UED algorithm acts as a "teacher," creating a series of tasks that are neither too easy nor too hard, pushing the "student" agent to develop robust and widely applicable skills.

Your task is to design a novel Unsupervised Environment Design algorithm. This involves creating a system that adaptively generates environment parameters to effectively train a separate RL agent. The objective is no longer just to find a policy that maximizes reward, but to design an environment generation process that produces a final agent with broad, generalizable capabilities. This requires balancing the generation of novel, challenging environments with those that remain solvable for the agent at its current skill level.

Below, we provide a description of a base environment whose parameters your UED algorithm will control. Your algorithm will be responsible for generating distributions over these parameters to create a curriculum. Be aware that the UED methodology you develop should be general enough to be applied to other families of parametric RL environments.
