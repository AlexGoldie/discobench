DESCRIPTION
The negated Branin function is a 2D benchmark with an asymmetric search domain and three global maxima of equal value. The function's multiple optima and structured landscape make it valuable for testing whether optimization algorithms can identify all high-value regions rather than converging prematurely to a single solution.

SEARCH SPACE
Dimensionality: 2D
Domain: x₁ ∈ [-5, 10], x₂ ∈ [0, 15]
Global maxima: Three locations with equal optimal values

CHARACTERISTICS
Three global maxima of identical value
Smooth, bowl-shaped structure
Asymmetric domain boundaries
Tests multi-modal optimization and thorough exploration
