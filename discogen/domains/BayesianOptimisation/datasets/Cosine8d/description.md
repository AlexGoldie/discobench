DESCRIPTION
The negated Cosine function in 8D is a high-dimensional periodic benchmark with a single global maximum and many regularly spaced local maxima. The function's dimensionality and multimodality test whether Bayesian optimization algorithms can scale effectively to higher dimensions while managing the curse of dimensionality.
