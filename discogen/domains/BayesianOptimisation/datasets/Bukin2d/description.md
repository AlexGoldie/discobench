DESCRIPTION
The negated Bukin function features a narrow, curved ridge that leads to a single global maximum. The function's steep gradients and irregular terrain make it particularly challenging for optimization algorithms, testing their ability to navigate difficult landscapes with precision and maintain progress along constrained paths.
