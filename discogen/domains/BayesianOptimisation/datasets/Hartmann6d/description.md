DESCRIPTION
The negated Hartmann function in 6D is a standard benchmark for moderate-dimensional optimization, consisting of a sum of Gaussian peaks with different heights and locations. With six local maxima and one global maximum, the function tests an algorithm's ability to distinguish between similarly-valued regions and converge to the true optimum in higher dimensions.
