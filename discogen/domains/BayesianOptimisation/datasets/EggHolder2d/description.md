DESCRIPTION
The negated Eggholder function is one of the most challenging 2D optimization benchmarks, featuring a highly non-convex, rugged landscape with deep valleys and sharp peaks. The function's deceptive structure—where many deep local maxima can mislead optimization algorithms away from the global optimum—makes it an excellent test of robustness and exploration strategy.
