DESCRIPTION
The negated Ackley function in 1D is a classic optimization benchmark featuring a single global maximum surrounded by numerous local maxima. The function's characteristic structure—a nearly flat outer region with many small peaks—makes it ideal for testing an algorithm's ability to explore the search space and escape from suboptimal solutions.
