DESCRIPTION
The negated HolderTable function features four global maxima of equal value arranged symmetrically across the search domain. The function's complex structure with multiple equivalent optimal solutions makes it valuable for testing whether optimization algorithms can identify all high-value regions and understand the symmetric nature of the objective.
