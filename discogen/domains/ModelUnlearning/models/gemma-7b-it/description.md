MODEL DESCRIPTION
Gemma 7B Instruct is a lightweight, open-source language model developed by Google DeepMind as part of the Gemma model family. Released in early 2024, it is designed to be accessible and efficient while maintaining strong performance on instruction-following tasks. The model is trained on a diverse dataset and fine-tuned specifically to respond helpfully to user prompts and queries. With 7 billion parameters, Gemma 7B-IT strikes a balance between computational efficiency and capability, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. It employs decoder-only transformer architecture and has been optimized for safe and responsible AI use, with built-in safety measures to reduce harmful outputs.
