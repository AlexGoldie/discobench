MODEL DESCRIPTION
Llama 2 13B is the medium-sized variant in Meta's Llama 2 foundation model series, offering enhanced capabilities through its 13 billion parameters while remaining computationally accessible for many research and production use cases. Released in July 2023, this model builds on the same pretraining approach as its 7B sibling but with increased capacity, leading to improved performance across a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks. The larger parameter count allows for more nuanced pattern recognition and better handling of complex reasoning tasks compared to smaller models. Like other base Llama 2 models, it serves as a foundation that can be fine-tuned for specific applications or used for in-context learning.
