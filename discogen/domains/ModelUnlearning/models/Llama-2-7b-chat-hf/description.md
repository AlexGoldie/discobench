MODEL DESCRIPTION
Llama 2 7B Chat is a conversational variant of Meta's Llama 2 family, specifically fine-tuned for dialogue applications. Released in July 2023, this model builds upon the base Llama 2 7B architecture with additional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve its conversational abilities and alignment with human preferences. The "hf" suffix indicates this is the Hugging Face compatible version, formatted for easy integration with the transformers library. With 7 billion parameters, it represents the smallest and most efficient member of the Llama 2 Chat family, designed to handle multi-turn conversations while maintaining context and providing helpful, harmless, and honest responses.
