MODEL DESCRIPTION
Qwen 2.5 1.5B Instruct is a compact instruction-tuned model from Alibaba Cloud's Qwen (Tongyi Qianwen) series, released as part of the Qwen 2.5 generation in late 2024. Despite its small 1.5 billion parameter count, this model demonstrates strong multilingual capabilities, particularly in Chinese and English, while maintaining efficiency for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The model is fine-tuned specifically for instruction-following tasks and incorporates improvements in reasoning, coding, and mathematical problem-solving compared to earlier Qwen iterations. Its compact size makes it suitable for edge deployment, mobile applications, and scenarios requiring low-latency inference.
