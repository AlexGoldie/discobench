MODEL DESCRIPTION
Phi-3.5 Mini Instruct is part of Microsoft's Phi-3.5 family, released in August 2024 as an evolution of the highly successful Phi series of compact language models. With 3.8 billion parameters, this instruction-tuned variant builds upon the "textbook quality data" philosophy while incorporating multimodal capabilities and extended context support of up to 128K tokens. The model demonstrates strong performance on reasoning, coding, and mathematical tasks despite its relatively small size, making it an excellent choice for edge deployment and scenarios where computational resources are limited. Phi-3.5 Mini represents Microsoft's continued commitment to creating efficient, capable models that challenge the assumption that larger always means better.
