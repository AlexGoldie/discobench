MODEL DESCRIPTION
Llama 3.2 3B Instruct is a mid-sized model from Meta's Llama 3.2 release, designed to provide a balance between efficiency and performance for instruction-following tasks. Released in September 2024, this 3-billion-parameter model sits between the ultra-compact 1B variant and larger models, offering enhanced reasoning and language understanding capabilities while remaining lightweight enough for edge deployment and real-time applications. The model benefits from the latest training techniques and architectural improvements in the Llama 3 series, including better multilingual support and improved instruction adherence. It is particularly well-suited for applications requiring quick inference times without sacrificing too much performance quality.
