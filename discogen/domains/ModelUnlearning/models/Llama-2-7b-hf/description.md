MODEL DESCRIPTION
Llama 2 7B is the base foundation model from Meta's second generation of Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama) series, released as open source in July 2023. This 7-billion-parameter decoder-only transformer model is pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of publicly available data, making it a versatile foundation for various natural language tasks. Unlike its chat-tuned counterpart, this base model has not been fine-tuned for specific instruction-following or conversational tasks, making it more suitable for further customization or as a research tool for understanding language model behavior. The "hf" designation indicates compatibility with Hugging Face's ecosystem, enabling straightforward loading and inference through the transformers library.
