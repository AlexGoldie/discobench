Greenhouse gas forecasting is a branch of time series analysis focused on predicting future atmospheric concentrations of climate-relevant gases based on historical measurements. Unlike static prediction tasks, forecasting requires models to extrapolate beyond observed data, capturing both long-term trends and periodic patterns to make accurate predictions about future states. The challenge lies in learning from limited historical records to project concentrations years or decades ahead, requiring knowledge of the systems and potentially leveraging inductive biases when developing the model.

Historically, atmospheric monitoring began in the late 1950s with pioneering measurements at remote observatories designed to track changes in Earth's atmosphere away from local pollution sources. Early analysis relied on simple trend fitting and seasonal decomposition methods. The field evolved through classical time series techniques in the 1970s-1980s (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to more sophisticated statistical models incorporating domain knowledge about atmospheric processes. The core task of observing historical concentrations, identifying patterns, and projecting future values remains fundamental to climate science and policy planning.

The objective of greenhouse gas forecasting is to learn a function that maps temporal features to future concentration values with minimal prediction error. Methods vary from classical statistical approaches that explicitly model trend and seasonality components, to machine learning methods that learn representations directly from data, to hybrid approaches that combine both paradigms. Success in forecasting requires balancing model complexity with available data, capturing both secular trends and cyclical patterns, and appropriately quantifying uncertainty in long-range predictions.

In practice, greenhouse gas forecasting supports climate modeling, policy evaluation, emissions monitoring, and scientific understanding of atmospheric processes. The choice of modeling approach should reflect the characteristics of the data—including temporal resolution, length of historical record, strength of seasonal cycles, and smoothness of trends—as these factors fundamentally shape what patterns can be learned and how far into the future accurate predictions remain possible.

Below, we provide descriptions of the datasets (time series of atmospheric gas concentrations) that you can use to develop forecasting algorithms. While you will train on specific gases with known temporal patterns, be aware that any code you develop may be applied to other atmospheric time series, and you will be assessed on generalization to held-out datasets—hence, ensure that your approach is adaptable to different temporal characteristics and forecast horizons.
