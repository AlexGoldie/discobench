  You should change the network file, which can be found in `networks.py`. In deep learning, the network provides the architecture of the model, and specifies the number of parameters, width of layers, and type of connections that those layers should have. You should not change the name or interface of the function `ActorCritic`. The network takes at input an observation from the RL environment, and must output a policy and a value. Here, you should focus on completing and improving our partial transformer architecture. A transformer uses attention to process sequences of data by allowing all input data to attend to all other input data.\n\n
