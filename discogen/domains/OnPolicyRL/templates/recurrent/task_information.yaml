  You should change the network file, which can be found in `networks.py`. In deep learning, the network provides the architecture of the model, and specifies the number of parameters, width of layers, and type of connections that those layers should have. You should not change the name or interface of the functions `ActorCritic` or `RecurrentModule`. The network takes at input an observation from the RL environment, whether there was a done (to reset the hidden state) and the previous hidden state, and must output a new hidden state, a policy and a value. Here, you should focus on completing and improving our partial recurrent architecture. A recurrent network uses some of its previous outputs at its next inputs, to enable memory.\n\n
