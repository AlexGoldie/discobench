This task evaluates continual learning for image classification under non‑stationary task sequences (e.g., class‑ or task‑incremental). The harness fixes data loading, model interface, and training loop; LLM‑editable modules are regularization, replay, sampling, scheduling, and optimizer. Training proceeds sequentially over tasks without revisiting prior task data (except via replay). We report per‑task accuracy, average accuracy, and forgetting/Backward Transfer from the final evaluation matrix. The default backend uses a standard image backbone with a dynamic classifier head sized to all seen classes.
