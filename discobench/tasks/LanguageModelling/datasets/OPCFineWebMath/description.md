DESCRIPTION
OPC-FineWeb-Math is a curated collection of mathematics-related web content recalled from FineWeb through iterative fastText-based retrieval. Created as part of the OpenCoder data collection effort, this dataset provides high-quality mathematical text including proofs, explanations, problem-solving discussions, and educational content. The corpus is designed to enhance language models' capabilities in mathematical reasoning and technical communication.

CONTENT
The dataset consists of math-centric web pages including:

Mathematical explanations and tutorials
Problem-solving discussions and solutions
Academic and educational math content
LaTeX-formatted equations and proofs
Math-focused forums and Q&A platforms

DATASET STRUCTURE
