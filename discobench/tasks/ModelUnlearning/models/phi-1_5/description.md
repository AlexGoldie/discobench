MODEL DESCRIPTION
Phi-1.5 is a compact 1.3-billion-parameter language model developed by Microsoft Research, released in September 2023 as a successor to the original Phi-1 model. Despite its relatively small size, Phi-1.5 demonstrates remarkable capabilities, particularly in common sense reasoning and language understanding tasks, challenging the conventional wisdom that larger models are always better. The model was trained using a "textbook quality" data approach, emphasizing high-quality, carefully curated training data over sheer volume. This focus on data quality rather than quantity allows Phi-1.5 to achieve performance comparable to much larger models on many benchmarks while being significantly more efficient to run and deploy.
