MODEL DESCRIPTION
Llama 3.1 8B Instruct is part of Meta's third-generation Llama model family, released in July 2024 as an improved successor to Llama 2. This instruction-tuned variant is specifically optimized for following user instructions and engaging in helpful dialogue, incorporating advances in training methodology and architectural improvements over previous generations. With 8 billion parameters, it represents a slight increase in capacity over Llama 2's 7B models while introducing significant improvements in reasoning, coding, and multilingual capabilities. The model supports an extended context length of up to 128K tokens, enabling it to process and reason over much longer documents and conversations than its predecessors.
