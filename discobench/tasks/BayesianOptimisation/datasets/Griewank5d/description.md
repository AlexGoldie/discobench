DESCRIPTION
The negated Griewank function in 5D combines a quadratic component with a product of cosine terms, creating a smooth landscape with many regularly distributed local maxima. The function becomes increasingly difficult as dimensionality increases, making it useful for testing how Bayesian optimization algorithms balance broad exploration with fine-grained exploitation.
