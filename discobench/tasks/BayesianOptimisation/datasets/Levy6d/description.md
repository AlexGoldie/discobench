DESCRIPTION
The negated Levy function in 6D features a single global maximum surrounded by a rugged landscape of many local maxima. The function's high dimensionality combined with its multimodal, irregular structure makes it challenging for optimization algorithms, requiring both broad exploration to avoid local traps and precise local search to converge accurately.
