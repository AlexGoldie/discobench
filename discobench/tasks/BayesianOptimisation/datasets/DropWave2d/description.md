DESCRIPTION
The negated Dropwave function is a symmetric 2D benchmark characterized by a central peak surrounded by concentric ripples of decreasing amplitude. The regular, repetitive structure creates multiple local maxima arranged in a symmetric pattern, testing an algorithm's ability to navigate smooth but highly multimodal landscapes.
