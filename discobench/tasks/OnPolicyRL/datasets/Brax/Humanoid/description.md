DESCRIPTION
In Brax Humanoid, a 2D one-legged hopper robot must learn to hop forward while maintaining balance. The hopper has 4 degrees of freedom controlling its leg joints and torso. The challenge is to coordinate hopping motions to move forward efficiently without falling over.

OBSERVATION SPACE
The observation is a ndarray with shape (15,) containing:

Joint angles and angular velocities of the 4 joints
Root position (y-coordinate height and x-coordinate)
Root orientation and angular velocity
Contact forces with the ground

ACTION SPACE
The action space consists of 3 continuous actions in the range [-1, 1]:

Torques applied to the thigh, leg, and foot joints

TRANSITION DYNAMICS

2D physics simulation in the sagittal plane
Single point of ground contact through the foot
Must maintain balance to avoid falling
Forward progress through hopping motions

REWARD

Positive reward for forward velocity
Small negative reward for energy expenditure (control cost)
Reward for staying alive (not falling)
Episode reward typically ranges from 0 to 3500+

STARTING STATE

Hopper starts in an upright standing position
Small random noise added to initial joint angles and velocities
Root height starts above ground level

EPISODE END
The episode ends if either of the following happens:

Termination: Hopper falls over (height below threshold or extreme angle)
Truncation: The length of the episode reaches max_steps (default: 1000)
