Automated algorithm discovery is a branch of machine learning focused on using computational search to create new algorithms. Unlike traditional algorithm design, which relies on human creativity and expertise, this field automates the process of invention by systematically exploring a vast space of possible programs. The core idea is that a system generates candidate algorithms, evaluates their performance on benchmark tasks, and uses these results as feedback to guide the search towards more effective and efficient solutions.

Historically, automated algorithm discovery draws inspiration from evolutionary computation and genetic programming, which apply principles of natural selection to evolve computer programs. Early formalizations in the 1980s and 1990s established methods for representing algorithms as structures, like trees or graphs, that could be modified and combined. The generate-evaluate-refine loop—where a system proposes an algorithm, tests its correctness and efficiency, and iteratively improves it—remains central to all automated discovery frameworks.

In practice, automated algorithm discovery has been used to find faster sorting and hashing routines, optimize fundamental computations like matrix multiplication, and design novel neural network architectures. Here, the objective is to discover new machine learning algorithms. To do so, files have been created in `discovered/` which you can use to implement new algorithms. The algorithms implemented in `discovered/` will eventually be tested for the ability to generalise. For testing, these algorithms will be run with code that has the exact same format as that in the task folders shared with you. Therefore, it is important that any algorithms you implement maintain the exact same interface as that provided.

Below, we provide a description of the domain of machine learning in which you will be discovering algorithms.
